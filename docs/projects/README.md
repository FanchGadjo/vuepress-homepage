  **The Making of Harry Potter's Wand**
  
  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.

  **Comparative Study on Decapsulation for Copper and Silver Wire-Bonded Devices**

  *François KERISIT, Bernadette DOMENGES and Michael OBEIN*
  
  The introduction of silver as bonding material led to new failure analysis issues. This study compares the efficiency of wet and dry chemistries for decapsulation on Cu and Ag-based alloy wires. It is shown that dry chemistry allows better control and selectivity on the EMC/ Cu and Ag-based bond wires.

  **A Prototype of Laser-Hollowed Integrated Circuit for Dielectric Sensing of Liquids: Perspectives for Medical Applications**

  *N. Prou, L. Leyssenne, I. Lahbib, B. Domengès, F. Kerisit, D. Lesénéchal, P. Descamps and S. Wane*
  
  This work investigates the impact of dielectric loading on the RF performances of integrated VCO and PLL systems. Both On-Chip and System-Level (On-Board) experimental characterizations are carried out to determine influence of various substances (resins, salted water, petroleum, sugar mixture) on frequency variations, taking into account the importance of mechanical fixture. Calibration and monitoring aspects are discussed towards real-time measurement of aqueous concentrations of liquids for medical applications.
